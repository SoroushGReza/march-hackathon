## **Design**

We chose a retro design theme using pixelated images and iconography, and by inserting pixelated effects to the components of the site. This was to match with the retro 80s/90’s/2000’s vibes that was a requirement of the hackathon

### Colour Scheme

!\[An image of Ada Lovelace wearing Boss glassest\]([https://res.cloudinary.com/dj2lk9daf/image/upload/v1742737056/ada-badass-dark-theme-purple-glasses.png_zpunfu.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dj2lk9daf/image/upload/v1742737056/ada-badass-dark-theme-purple-glasses.png_zpunfu.png))Inspired by the **retro TV colors** of the '80s and '90s, our palette blends nostalgia with modern empowerment. Each color is thoughtfully chosen to evoke emotions and encourage action:

- #8c4ffe; Purple – Representing Women Supporters and Contributors, empowering and honoring women in the tech world.

- #7acc00; Green – For Projects, signaling a green light to go for it, encouraging women to dive into opportunities.

- #30ceec; Blue Light – For Milestones, symbolizing the step-by-step journey toward achieving big goals, like reaching for the sky.

- #f5a742; Orange – For Mentors, reflecting the heat of learning, growth, and shared knowledge in this collaborative environment.

- #e50004; Red – For Accents and Warnings, representing the passion and energy of women in tech, acknowledging the highs and lows of the journey.

### Typography

- Orbitron

- Press Start P2

### Imagery

- Image of Ada Lovelace - she wrote what is considered the first computer algorithm, demonstrating that women have always been in tech.

### End Product Design Changes

- There weren’t any design changes made - we managed to stick to our original plan.

## **Features**

- **Stripe Integration:** Seamless Stripe checkout for both donations and sponsorships.

- **Successful Payment Handling:** Updates the database and confirms transactions after a successful payment.

- **Donation Success Page:** Displays transaction details upon completion.

- **Display other projects :** Lists projects also available for sponsorship on success page.

### Responsiveness

The app resizes smoothly across various screen sizes, ranging from mobile devices to large desktop screens.

### Header

The header contains a logo t and nav brand that links back to the home page from every page. The nav links are easy to read with appropriate icons. The nav bar links change depending on who is logged in. There is easy access to a user’s profile from the navbar and from the dropdown on the right. There is also a button that switches between dark and light mode.

### Footer

The footer contains copyright information only.

### Interactive Elements

Buttons have hover effects to show that they can be actively clicked. On mobile and tablets a burger icons displays a dropdown nav list. There is a dropdown list in the nav bar  for profile, settings and to logout. A favourites tray appears on a user’s profile page when the star is clicked, and disappears when the star is clicked a 2nd time.

### Sign up Form

There is a sign up form with three user types to select from, which creates three different types of user accounts. Each account has access to different areas of the app. The form has required fields so a prospective user cannot sign up without a username, email address, or password.

## **Future Features**

In the future we would like to implement the following features:

- Display a sponsorship page that lists all women in tech signed up on the platform and gives you the ability to sponsor them by donating funds to keep them going working on open source projects

### Creator Comments

💻💜

Inspired by the visionary Ada Lovelace, Connection Engine is an open-source innovation hub that transforms how women engage in tech. More than just a platform—it’s a career accelerator that seamlessly connects women developers, open-source projects, and industry leaders, ensuring contributions are recognized, rewarded, and funded.

💡 How It Works:

✔ Code with Purpose – Work on real-world open-source projects, from startups to industry-driven initiatives.

✔ Earn & Advance – Gain verified milestones, professional recognition, and financial sponsorships for your work.

✔ Project-Driven Mentorship – Mentors are project owners or experienced contributors, ensuring guidance is strictly aligned with project technologies to provide clear, actionable support—no misdirection, just focused learning.

✔ Beyond Inclusion—Industry Integration – Not just a space for women, but a tech ecosystem where talent drives success—regardless of gender.

Connection Engine is rewriting the future of open source: where women’s contributions don’t just count—they lead. 💻✨
