          <p>Ada Lovelace was the world's first software engineer: she wrote what is considered the first computer algorithm:
            It was designed to calculate Bernoulli numbers.
            Her algorithm described a sequence of operations the machine would follow, making it the first published computer program.</p>

          <h3 class="card-title">Women in Tech</h3>
          <p>The Connection Engine is designed to give Women in Tech the opportunity to work on open-source projects of their choosing. The projects are fully-funded by either the open-source project maintainers, or by donations made directly to the Women in Tech.</p>
            <p>This allows women to take their rightful place in the tech world and have the time and funds to showcase their amazing skills</p>

          <p>Open-source projects can be submitted to the engine and advertised for Women in Tech to choose from, giving them the freedom to pick the types of projects they want to work on while being fully sponsored to do so.</p>
            <p>This is how the tech world can embrace the awesome force that is Women in Tech</p>

          <p>Mentors offer advice and guidance to the Women for the duration of a project. Women in Tech can view mentor profiles to see what projects they've been connected to in the past, and choose the mentor that suits their requirements.</p>
          <p>This is how Women in Tech can make sure they're getting appropriate support.</p>
